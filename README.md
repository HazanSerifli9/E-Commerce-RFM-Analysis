# E-Commerce-RFM-Analysis

This will generate RFM scores, customer segments, and visualizations based on the provided e-commerce data.


## RFM Analysis Explanation

RFM analysis is based on three factors:

- Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase
- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases
- Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends

This analysis helps in segmenting customers into groups like:

- Best Customers: Recent purchases, frequent buyers, high spenders
- Loyal Customers: Frequent buyers with average or low purchase amounts
- Big Spenders: Infrequent buyers with high purchase amounts
- Lost Customers: Haven't purchased in a long time

The project uses these factors to assign scores and create meaningful customer segments.
